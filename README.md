#InoBar
InoBar is a project of a PolyBar for Windows with GPL license. Soon it will be released for Linux as well. InoBar is built with Python and is designed to provide Windows users with a PolyBar-like experience. To create custom themes, it is necessary to replace the Python file and create a backup, then make it executable. This is a simple project for installing themes. Below is a tutorial on how to do it."

2:Edit Sytle of TKinter
3:Add features
4:Publish

#Depedencies
To ensure that users can run your program, it is important to provide information about the required libraries and dependencies. In your case, you mentioned that you are developing a PolyBar for Windows using Python. The required libraries may vary depending on the specific functionalities of your project, but here are some common libraries used in Python GUI applications and status bar systems:

tkinter: Python's standard library for creating graphical interfaces.
psutil: Library for obtaining system information such as CPU and memory usage.
datetime: Library for date and time manipulation.
PIL (or Pillow): Library for image processing.
win32gui: Library for interacting with the Windows API.
win32con: Library for accessing constants from the Windows API.
pywin32: Package that provides support for the Windows API.
In addition to these libraries, you may need other dependencies specific to your project. Make sure to document all the required libraries and their corresponding versions so that users can install and run your program successfully.
#Bugs
The project may have bugs such as: windows overlapping the bar and not staying underneath. I don't know how to resolve these bugs, I tried using Chat GPT but there is no up-to-date method to do it. I will only be able to do it when Chat GPT 4.0 is released.
